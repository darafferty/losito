LoSiTo: the LOFAR Simulation Tool
=================================

LoSiTo is a Python package that can be used to produce simulated LOFAR visibilities with a variety
of corruptions, including:

- Time- and direction-dependent ionospheric effects (TEC and rotation measure)
- Beam effects
- Station-based delay effects (clock and polarization misalignment)
- Realistic noise
